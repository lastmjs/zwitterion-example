# Zwitterion Example

An example application built with the help of Zwitterion. TypeScript, ES6, async/await, ES modules, Object spread...but no complicated build step. The TypeScript files were referenced directly from `<script>` tags in the client's HTML.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo in production. The application was built statically with `zwitterion --build-static` and served up on a CDN: 

## Development

```bash
git clone [ssh or https repository URL]
cd zwitterion-example
npm install
npm start
```
